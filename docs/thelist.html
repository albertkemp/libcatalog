        <h2>0 birds</h2>
        <p>Seriously? We have came to Metung leaving on the 1st January 2023. And I don’t think we will see many birds. Driving along, we listen to many podcasts and me and my brother want to put on some stories. So we do some but after that my dad says he gets to put on a podcast that went for ages and I didn’t really hear much of it but I got the impression that it was an interview with an American classical music composer or something. Anyway, after that we listened to the story. We stopped to have lunch somewhere in Gippsland and I was very annoyed when I saw a plaque saying something about Willow Park and something about keeping out land-seeking Melbournians. It. was really annoying. In a tree, though I saw something that might have been some sort of honeyeater. All I remember was that it was a vague blue sort of colour and anyway I couldn’t identify it as anything. I also saw an Australian pelican in a dam on a farm. One of the first birds for the year I suppose. When we finally got to Metung, we came into our rented house. I don’t know what I can say about it but it wasn’t my favourite place to be staying. There was a room with shutters that I was sleeping in and all that. Anyway, that’s not really related. Afterwards, as we did a walk by the Lake shore, and I saw a really big square boat with beds and outside deck chairs and I think it was a houseboat. From the jetty, we also saw lots of Black Swans, Silver Gulls and a Little Pied Cormorant. Afterwards, some Chestnut Teals flew into the lake. As we moved up the beach, we came upon a sculpture of the Charles Edward boat or something. While we were there, I said that Pelicans were coming in but they turned out not to be pelicans but Australian White Ibis, another bird for my list. And then we saw another group of large birds flew over, I looked in the binoculars and I could hardly believe what I saw. It was a flock of White-faced Herons. These birds are fairly common and I had recently stalked up behind one at the Yarra River in Melbourne but I had never seen them flying in flocks like this. On the way home from the shore, more corellas flew over plus a few Galahs and I realised that I had lost my camera… </p>

        <h1>Chapter One:</h1>
        <h2>11 birds</h2>
        <p>The next day, I woke up after a very uncomfortable night and started a year list. So I made a list of birds this year. First off, I started ticking off all the birds I had seen yesterday which included: Black Swan, Silver Gull, White-faced Heron, Little Pied Cormorant, Rainbow Lorikeet, Welcome Swallow, Little Corella, Galah and Chestnut Teal. Then I started looking at all the birds at the Deck. I ticked off a whole bunch like: Australian Magpie and Crested Pigeon. And then I saw some rustling and mysterious silhouettes moving in a bush not 20 metres away so I went to investigate. It turned out to be a pair of Crimson Rosellas, beautiful birds and a great start to my year. Afterwards, some little parrots flew over, but I couldn’t confirm what species they were. So when another big flock flew over I ran out under them and I could see they were Little Lorikeets.  I also heard lots of Laughing Kookaburras and Eastern Whipbirds but I couldn’t add them as I hadn’t actually seen them. On the way to the beach in the morning. I added a Magpie Lark, Little Raven and Indian Myna to my list. I also couldn’t quite confirm the corellas, I definitely know some of them are Little Corellas but I wonder if some of them are Long-billed Corellas. That night, we went for a swim after dinner and I added Wood Duck to the list and a lot of weedy seaweed. After that, I went stalking some birds and I thought I had a Sooty Oystercatcher but when I got close it swam away. It was a Chestnut Teal. And the birds I had thought were some types of shorebird were Silver Gulls. I also was very close to two Black Swans, and they made honking calls to each other as they swam away like some type of communication.  That night as we had dinner we noticed a Little Wattlebird out the window. I took it as a new species as even though I had seen lots of Wattlebirds I hadn’t noticed if they were Reds or Littles. And I hadn’t even identified different ones and I took them all as Red Wattlebirds. Plus, after that I only saw Little Wattlebirds. The next day, me and my brother played a little in the garden and suddenly we saw a Stick Insect the underside of the porch. It was huge. It must have been about 30 centimetres long. After that we drove  to Paynesville. Along the drive, I spotted Long-billed Corellas and Sulphur-crested Cockatoos, two more birds for my list. When we were in Paynesville, we took a couple of toilet stops, my dad got a loaf of multigrain bread from the Paynesville bakery and cafe and we waited for a ferry to come from the other side of the channel. We took a ferry over to Raymond Island that was very slow - I thought that we were going to go out of the channel or something but instead it just took us across a channel that was like 40 metres wide. And they could’ve just built a bridge. As we got off, we came to a jetty with boats docked and it was teeming with birdlife. Many birds for my list such as Little Black Cormorant, Great Cormorant, Crested Terns and a couple of Masked Lapwings. Anyway when we were on Raymond Island, we started looking for the koalas but I couldn’t see any. After a while, my aunt spotted one but it was very hidden by leaves, and shortly afterward we spotted another that was in a tree outside an anglican church thing on Raymond Island. Also, I stopped for a bit and spotted a juvenile Crimson Rosella which hung around a little and then flew away after calling from the adults. In another tree I spotted some musk lorikeets - another bird for my list. After many more crimson rosellas we spotted another koala and three more after that, the last two hidden by leaves. Six koalas in total. Well I was pretty satisfied - five new birds for the list that day. The next day, I went on a walk with my dad in midmorning, and first we walked over down to the lake and I had to have a pee. But in the bush that I went to do my business in, two brown thornbills fluttered around - another bird for my year list. While we walked along the lake, I saw an Australian Pied Oystercatcher flying over the lake which was yet another bird and then we walked down along a different side road. Along the boardwalk, A Superb Fairy-wren perched in the bush which was another new bird. I just saw some Silver Gulls - already on my list and Black Swans, which were both on my list but afterwards, I noticed a Little Pied Cormorant and something behind it that could have been a good bird. I got closer and it was an Immature Pacific Gull - a bird that was not on my year list yet. After that, I saw a Silver Gull with a big fish and two adult Pacific Gulls came and snatched the fish from the Silver Gull - I thought that was very mean. That evening, we went for a swim in the lake - or inlet whatever you call it and we went to a ladder on the jetty. We tried to get over to the other side of the jetty but there were people fishing and there was a sign saying you shouldn’t swim less than 20 metres from the jetty so we were already disobeying the signs. So we kept a pretty wide berth of the jetty. That night, I wanted to sleep early because my dad was frequently reporting sightings of Water Rats. So I had an early night that night. The next morning, I was rushed out of bed by my dad and me and my brother all three of us went down to the jetty by the boat docks with the jetties. After that, a long while after that we saw a splash and a white-tipped tail and a water rat came to the surface. They are beautiful animals, like a stretched large rat with a long slender tail with a white tip. After that, we saw another in a bush and then it came out, swam under the boardwalk and splashed up to the surface for another breath. Then it dived under again. A little while after that, two Australian pelicans landed in the harbour and seemed like they were catching fish. A few little schools of fish swam around under water in that place and we saw what looked like an injured Garfish. And we made our way home. 38 birds, pretty good. After that, still in the morning but since the water rat walk was in the early morning this was in mid morning. We went to a national park in Nungurner which had a very long name. When we went in the front, we took the Whistling Kite track. I seriously didn’t see any whistling kites and I heard lots of other birds that weren’t visible to my eye. Lots of grey fantails fluttered around but they were already on the list. Also, some little birds that looked like Brown Thornbills with red rumps but when I looked in the bird book all the possible species were out of the range and the most likely species was the Brown Thornbill, which was already on the list. I heard lots of Eastern Whipbirds but I couldn’t count them as I hadn’t actually observed them with my eye. And lots of vague silhouettes fluttered about but I couldn’t identify as they darted in and out of vegetation, silhouetted by the sun. Along the Homestead Track, my aunt startled a large pigeon, which flew away explosively beating its wings like whips. She thought it wasn’t a pigeon she said: its huge! But I recognised that flying as that of a pigeon and I knew that some pigeons could be big - I was thinking of the Wonga Pigeon. But we kept walking, and suddenly the pigeon exploded again and disappeared. I thought we had seen the last of it and I was sad I couldn’t identify it but after having a brief visit to the Bird Hide, we came back and saw a large shape on the path not 20 metres away. So I told everyone to be a little quiet and I calmly followed the bird till I could focus my camera on it. I was about 80% sure that it was a Wonga Pigeon, and I took a photo. And it turns out that it was a Wonga pigeon since I identified it when we got back home. I had never seen this bird before so it was a lifer. Already a lifer? It’s only day four of 365. After that walk, just when we were finishing I picked up a couple of Crimson Rosella feathers and then I saw a Laughing Kookaburra calling. This one wasn’t even on my list yet as I had only heard them rather than seen them so I jumped up and saw one in a distant tree. But I confirmed that it was a kookaburra so that’s bird 40 of my year list. The next day, I was woken up for the early morning walk but I was still quite tired so I didn’t go and I regretted it when I heard that they had seen two White-bellied Sea Eagles. Anyway, I wasn’t looking forward to the Lakes Entrance walk but it turned out to be good because even though when we got there I ticked off a couple of Rock Doves which are like the most common and boring and annoying pigeon. But I got excited when we entered the forest, and did a long walk, ages and ages of hiking up and down steps in thick vegetation. I noticed a sign saying that the Eastern Whipbird and Eastern Yellow Robin foraged on the ground so I got on the ground in the vegetation to have a look. But instead of seeing a bird, I heard a rustling and was excited and then a skink scuttled right past me within 10 seconds of getting in there. I got out again as we were moving on and after walking a long time and me seeing a bird which I wasn’t sure of the species, and another that was probably a female Superb Fairy wren or there is a 99% chance that it was anyway. But finally, as I was losing hope of seeing anything good, I noticed a rustling just by the path and out hopped an adult Eastern Whipbird. People say that this bird is elusive, secretive, rarely seen by people and out it comes hopping over the path in plain view. Another lifer on Day 5 of 2023. Day six, after an early night because I didn’t want to dip out on a bird again like I had for the last Early Morning Walk and so I should’ve. Because even though the walk seemed like it was bad and a waste of time, we walked around the piers and everything and didn’t see a single good bird or a water rat or anything like that and I just thought that that was that and that was a bad walk. But when we were very near to arriving back at home, a fast-flying bird went at some 
            corellas perching on the telephone wire. That attracted my attention and before you knew it I had the binoculars on a Peregrine Falcon diving down at the Corellas. They flew away, what a natural scene and the Peregrine landed on a nearby tree. I tried to identify it from there but I couldn’t get a clear view but when it took off again I got a good view of it. By the time I had checked the bird book, I was sure that it was a Peregrine. So another lifer and bird 44 of the year list. After that we were going to some different parks round Bairnsdale and the first one we stopped at was a game reserve. I was already sort of not quite sure about going in and after that, once we had walked a bit, I saw a duck. I was pretty sure it was an Australian Shelduck, but I didn’t get the best view of it and it could have been a Chestnut Teal which was already on the list. So I decided not to add it and after walking a bit, the path came to a stop. It was just reeds after that, like a big forest of them. It looked like it had snakes and of course we weren’t going to fight through a big forest of them. So we went to another park which turned out to be a game reserve as well. But this one was alright because it had proper paths and it didn’t seem like a game reserve anyway. Well we were going on like this for a while and I saw a few Superb Fairy-wrens and a soaring bird which I could not identify but I was annoyed because everyone else was scaring all the birds. And my aunt was really ahead and she was going on a boardwalk which led out into the lake. So I went up there and went left, on a boardwalk across a small pond and went to look for birds there. My dad followed me so I figured that everyone was just going different ways and I looked for birds there. After a lot of Brown Thornbills and Superb Fairy-wrens I finally spotted a White-browed Scrubwren, which was bird 45 of my year list. After that, we shortly came to the end of that path onto a larger path which was presumably where my aunt and little brother were walking. (They later claimed that they had seen a long black snake and a tiger snake). But on that path I saw a Red-browed finch which of course was another bird for my list. After that, we went along the first boardwalk and I picked up Swamp Harrier. I’ve seen this bird before but this was the first time for this year. After that, we went home and I identified the Swamp Harrier. That was our last full day in Metung. The next day, we went on a quick walk - no new species but some water rats. And then we packed to go to Jindabyne. Along the way, I picked up Pied Currawong which wasn’t on my list before for some reason and something that might have been a King Parrot. I held back on the King Parrot because I couldn’t properly identify it so we kept driving. When we got to the place where we were staying, I saw something that might have been two Spotted Pardalotes and a thornbill sort of thing that I couldn’t identify. I also saw another bird which turned out to be a White-browed Scrubwren. But finally I got a new bird - Black-faced Cuckoo-shrike. Later, in a walk after dinner, I spotted a bird on a big tall tree and it turned out to be a Dusky Woodswallow. Another lifer on day 9 of the year. The next day, we went on the Kosciuszko chairlift and walked all the way to the top of Mount Kosciuszko. Along the walk, I added Australian Raven which somehow hadn’t crept into my list before and Australasian Pipit. I also saw a soaring bird but I couldn’t confirm what it was, either Australian Hobby or Nankeen Kestrel. The next day, I was sick and spent about an hour in the bathroom feeling like I was about to vomit. In the end I did a poo and flushed the toilet and as soon as I did that I felt that feeling and about a litre of vomit went into the toilet. After a shopping trip, and looking at Lake Jindabyne, this day was unsuccessful because I hadn’t managed to add any more new birds. But, around after lunch, things seemed to turn around. A brown raptor came and perched on a tree outside the cabin, and after running out in my socks, grabbing the binoculars and my bird book I tried to identify it. I thought it was a nankeen kestrel,  so from the balcony I took a photo of the bird, and later identified it as a Nankeen Kestrel. Not a lifer, but pretty good anyway. Afterwards, while we were playing Disc Golf, I spotted a group of Yellow-rumped Thornbills. I haven’t fully identified them before,  so this was a lifer. And they were bird sixty of the year list.</p>

        <h1>Chapter Two:</h1>
        <h2>48 birds</h2>
        <p>So after all that, I had come up with 60 birds. This seems like a little record and I took time to celebrate. But since I was feeling sick, things started going to a crawl. On a walk the day before yesterday, we went on a walk by a stream and no new birds were added. We did see a very big blue tongue lizard though. And over here there are so many March flies (not saying that is a good thing). The march flies are stinging and I kept getting panicky about them biting me. And a lot of Pied Currawongs and little skinks and weird insects and a couple of birds that could have been Little Friarbirds but I didn’t have the binoculars and they could have been anything. So after that walk, the list was still stuck on 60 and plus I was sick. The next day, we went on another walk that seemed to produce no results. But I went anyway because I didn’t want to miss out. This walk was pretty long to me - it was to Dead Horse Gap and I thought I wouldn’t see anything. This time I did bring the binoculars, but this meant trouble as well. A bird like a honeyeater landed on the branch above me and began to sing. Well, the binoculars had their caps on and they were in a velcro case and that case was in a zip bag. So, I spent a while fiddling with the zip - since that zip is hard to use and the bird stayed where it was. Then I took out the case and opened it. It made a loud noise but the bird stayed there. Then I hastily took off the caps on the front and then reached underneath for the caps on the back and I looked down for a second while I took out the last one. And guess what. When I looked up again, the bird had gone. And I strained my eyes, hoping it was somewhere where I could still see it, but I heard it singing, just out of sight. Well, that annoyed me a lot and nothing else seemed to show up. And after lots of tiring and bothersome hilly walking we finally arrived at the next rest place. It was a wooden bench by a waterfall. Well I sat there a long while drinking a lot of water and we saw two Crimson Rosellas up the hill. And lots of little brown birds, but seriously if anyone can identify a brown blur in flight, it’s not me. Well, we finally moved on, but while everyone else left, I was just getting up, but as soon as they left, a little honeyeater landed in a tree right in front of me. I couldn’t identify it on the spot, and I didn’t have a pencil or paper or a camera or anything with me so I just took a mental picture and hoped that I would be able to identify it when we got back. I had low hopes for that one, but when I got home, it was unmistakably a Yellow-faced Honeyeater. So that was a lifer and bird 61 of my list. There weren’t any new birds after that, however. We walked along what seemed like a neverending patch of heath and finally got to the end of the walk. However, over there there was an annoying walking group who were armed with sticks, hats, you name it. And the guide lugged a big esky full of drinks and chips and chocolate biscuits. They seemed totally overarmed for such a walk as this and they were very annoying as well. When we turned back, I put on a faster pace and it didn’t seem long before we arrived back at the Yellow-faced Honeyeater place. There we waited for my Grandma which took a while because she was walking quite slowly - I’m not saying that’s surprising or anything and when she got there, we sat for a bit and then the rest of us went to get the car and we would pick her up. The walk back to the start of the walk seemed like ages and then the walk along the road to the car was so long. And I fell behind and got further and further away. I also saw a mother Wood Duck with quite a few babies but Wood Duck was already on my list. I was walking so slowly that they seemed to disappear. I thought that was because I was just too slow but the reason was they had already got the car and shortly afterward I boarded. So after we went to pick up grandma, I only had 1 new bird to add to my list. And then I didn’t even know it. The next day, we went on another walk. This one seemed like there would be no new birds. The walk was shorter then yesterday’s walk - thank goodness but it was still pretty long. We walked on a lot of these dusty trails and I went ahead. I kept hoping that I would see a Rose Robin but none came. Most other people in my family like the mountains so much, but I don’t have a very good experience with them so far. Because I wasn’t really feeling normal these whole few days. And seriously, this dry Alpine Air is not helping. Well the walk went on and on and on and I could just hear the rushing river. The walk was long and soon we got back to the car. But we had lunch at a picnic table and I tried having a dip in the stream at that point. But I didn’t even go under because the water was ice cold. After drying off and putting on clothes I finished my lunch and we sat there for a while. Then my dad said: I just saw a little brown bird pop into that hole in the tree there. I waited for it to come out and I saw it. I couldn’t identify it then and there but there was a nest and a pair kept coming in and out of the tree hollow. So I focused the binoculars on them and when I saw the bird I knew what it was. Striated Pardalote. So I had a lifer, it’s nest and my 62nd bird! My brother spotted a large Blue-tongued Lizard underneath the pardalote nest. It stayed there for quite a few seconds, and then lumbered into the grass in that area. My brother went to where it had gone, and I did too but no one could find the lizard again. And it really only is the 13 of January, 2023. That afternoon, there was a hailstorm. Hailstones the size of golf balls fell and bounced over the ground. I had never seen hail so big. Bang bang bang it went. The next day, we were going to go on a walk just by Jindabyne Lake. Along the way, we spotted some soaring raptors, so we pulled over the car, and I identified them as Wedge-tailed Eagles. These were a bird for my year list as well as lifers so I was very excited. I identified them because of that wedge-tail. Plus, what other raptor is huge and black and broad and just that size. Well anyway that’s enough about how majestic and royal the eagle is and we moved on along the walk. I did not even manage to add any new birds along the walk, so it seems ironic that my only bird was before the actual thing  started. Along the actual walk, we moved along the lake. My dad called me saying there was a bird in a tree singing and everyone listened to it. Everyone else moved on but we stuck around and waited ages for the bird to show itself. It came up onto the tree but the sun was wrong. We went to a better place and then it flew to the other side of the road onto a perfect exposed tree branch. It was a yellow-faced honeyeater, which was the bird that I already had so it was quite a disappointment. Along the walk, we stopped to rest and there were two lizards. One was sitting on a rock sunning itself which everyone noticed and then suddenly I noticed one right next to me which was quite scary. Not saying the lizard was scary - I just got a bit surprised because I didn’t know that it was there. After the walk, we went back home and now we are getting close to leaving. We are going to leave tomorrow but I am on 63 birds and that is pretty good. That evening, we went on a night walk.  Going along the property, I saw some little birds that I thought were Yellow-rumped Thornbills but they were actually Striated Pardalotes. I saw both of these birds frequently in the trees, the thornbills being slightly smaller. I also saw a small, swallow like bird and when I got close I thought it was a Flame Robin or one of the species that were related to Flame Robin. I later settled on Scarlet Robin but I didn’t put it on the list because I wasn’t sure of the species. That night, I also saw again the Dusky Woodswallows and I confirmed them as Dusky Woodswallow and not Masked because of a closer look and now I knew what they looked like. That walk, also we startled a few groups of Eastern Rosellas and now I had them certain as the first tick I was unsure. But now I was certainly certain so I can go to bed feeling confident that I have Dusky Woodswallow and Eastern Rosella in the bag. Later in the walk, when we were near going back, I saw a Rufous Whistler. That was an exciting lifer and I can confirm that for the list as well. So even though I was in agony about the red robin, I could still rest assured I had a new bird for my now 64 bird list. The next morning, I really wanted that robin so my dad said I could go for a walk around the camp property. So I started off. I saw a Nankeen Kestrel go into the tree, and this time it was an 100% sure Nankeen Kestrel so I have this one confirmed. I also saw a rabbit and I called to the sky in general: Wedge-tailed Eagles, come down for there is a fat rabbit for your dinner. They probably didn’t hear. Going onto the Disc Golf course, I kept a wide berth of the Alpacas and looked at lots of the kangaroos there. These weren’t as tame as some I’d seen but they seemed curious so I showed them the picture of the Flame Robin in my bird book as if they had seen it. They looked curiously at me and then backed off, some hopping a distance and some hopping a few metres and then looking at me again for another inspection. After looking at the kangaroos for a while, I was still on the Scarlet Robin mission (that is if it was a Scarlet Robin) but none showed up. I worked my way along the fenceline, scaring away quite a few kangaroos but no Scarlet Robin showed up. When I had to go,  I turned my head and spotted a deer on the other property. It was eating, I think it was a female, but as soon as it lifted it’s head which wasn’t long, it galloped away over whole bushes and clumps of long grass to get away from me. But I was still glad that I got a few proper views of the deer anyway. Eventually, I had to go back, followed by Laughing Kookaburras. I tried to 
            imitate their call but I don’t know of their opinion because they flew away whenever I did so. I also said goodbye to all the birds in the campsite - well probably not all of them but just a few I had seen and I also saw a Willie Wagtail harassing a Pied Currawong, and it flew around it with it’s call. The Pied Currawong seemed quite intimidated and fluttered a little cautiously. When I got back to our chalet, my brother reported a Juvenile Currawong in someone else’s garden. He said it had just gone behind a tree, and it came out. He was right, even though he was six years old. It was a juvenile Pied Currawong. After that we were going on the drive back to Melbourne and it was a better time to see an Emu. So I really kept my eyes peeled because if I did this would be bird 65. Finally, I spotted a sort of big dark shape with a long neck but smaller than a cow in the grass. We drove closer but I couldn’t see it any more but seriously - what else could it be. So I just wrote Emu down on the list and it was bird 65. After a long strenuous 7 hour drive, we finally arrived home, and were having dinner. And as if a gift from old Melbourne, a Grey Butcherbird came and landed on our clothesline - a favourite perching spot. So that was bird 66 of the year, and now the bird list would slow considerably. The rest of that day, during dinner no new birds showed up. That night I had a weird dream about being in a schoolroom,  and I had to pick up this pile of my own clothes and now that I think about it I must have had a spare change of clothes. But anyway, so I was using up this whole couch with the clothes with everyone staring. I already had clothes on and anyway, after that the teacher turned into a witch and she struck the ground with a broomstick a few times and then made a magic finger formalise in the air. Then she said: Guess who I will throw this finger at. And she threw it at me of course who was taking up a whole couch and had a whole change of clothes. And then I think I ate it and I was fine and the witch turned back into a teacher and then everyone did the Carrot Jig which I think was a thing where you got a carrot and made it dance while singing music. And then everyone’s carrots broke and I needed to go down a rabbit hole, or really the teachers just said that someone would go down the rabbit hole, and I prophesied that there was a baby goose and two baby rabbits and a baby dog in the hole, all tied up in chains because their mother was away, and that the goose was a spy goose. And then I abruptly woke up and thought well if they were to cut the baby’s chains, then would we have to lock up the spy goose because he would surely spread news to the other geese about something or other. Yes, that was a very weird dream. I do have dreams like that - because yesterday’s night I had a dream that involved a Nankeen Night-Heron turning into a Great-crested Grebe. Yes, very birdy of course and there were jumping herons in the dream as well. Well that’s enough of that. Today, so far there are no new birds and I don’t think there will be any until we go to a birding place. Great. Saturday, the 21st January 2022 and we are heading off to the Western Treatment Plant - probably the best birding place in the whole of Victoria. When we got there, we got off, and I noticed some little birds that were probably Golden-headed Cisticolas in the grass, but by the time I got out the binoculars from the back of the car, I didn’t know where they had gone. Then after that, flocks and flocks of ducks flew over, looking in the binoculars, I identified them as Australian Shelducks - which are a dead cert for the the treatment plant. In the first lake we passed, we spotted two Brolgas, which are a very exciting bird and bird 68 of the list. After the Brolgas, we went to a nearby Bird Hide, where I added Pacific Black Ducks - the most common duck ever, to my list. They somehow hadn’t come in before because this was the 21st day. But the ducks were mostly shelducks - thousands of them. Along the drive, we picked up Brown Falcon - Bird 69 and bird 70 happened to be a Yellow-billed Spoonbill. Shortly after that, we passed a huge group of mixed Yellow-billed and Royal Spoonbills, which were 71, and after that, at the end of that path, we came to a group of five Brolgas, three of which I got good photos of.  I added more in the various lakes. We added Golden-headed Cisticola, finally as 72 and a little bird that I thought was a White-fronted Chat. I couldn’t be 100% sure, though so I held back on that one. After lots of infuriating waiting and trouble focusing, I finally got some decent photos of a male bird, and I would identify them when we got home. So I was on 72 birds. Further along the drive I picked up a Male Australian Shoveler, as bird 73 and a Pink-eared Duck as 74. After that, I picked up Eurasian Coot, and Grey Teal, both common but 76 birds. And finally, as if of a parting gift, a Cape Barren Goose appeared on the path in front of us twice, and I added that to the list. The Cape Barren Goose is quite uncommon so I took this as a very exciting bird as my 77th bird. When I got home, I identified the chat bird as White-fronted Chat and another Martin like bird that I had seen as Fairy Martin. So now I have 79 birds - almost 80!!</p>
            <br><h1>Chapter Three</h1>
            <h2>79 birds</h2>
            <p>So now it’s Monday afternoon. I decided that the mysterious robin was a Flame Robin, so that was bird 80 of the list. But no new birds are coming at all. We are going to go on a bird walk at Point Cook on Saturday, but that is still a while off. Well, less than a week which is pretty good first of all. And I don’t know the birds there but I think I’ll be able to add some new birds to my list. 

                After a few days, I am writing on Thursday, This morning I went to a friend of mine’s house. They live in Mount Macedon so I was expecting some new birds. It was a 1.30hr drive, so when we finally got there, I was pleased to get out of the car. The rest of the people in my family went off for a walk by a lake and came back reporting descriptions of many birds that I think could have been Yellow-faced Honeyeater, Straited Pardalote and  Flame/Scarlet Robin. Meanwhile, I was having a good time with the birds. I observed New Holland Honeyeater from the back porch, which was already bird 81 and a bird that I thought I wasn’t going to see any time soon. Later, I noticed some birds flying away in the other property, which I thought were Pied Currawongs, but they looked slightly different, with curved beaks and a call which was totally wrong. I guessed that they were White-winged Choughs, and when I got home, I identified from the call. Anyway, they just looked like the Choughs because of the general appearance, so they were the 82nd bird and a very exciting lifer, since I had always hoped to see one. Afterwards, no new birds were added so I won’t talk about that but in general today was pretty good. After all, I’m on 82 birds, and 18 more is definitely achievable this year. After all, we are currently on the 26 of January.
                
                Today, it’s Friday, a sort of no birds day. But I’m not really sweating anything since I only have 18 birds till the 100 mark. But still, it’s not like seeing 100 birds in the year is really impressive, it’s only about an eighth of Australia’s bird species (including vagrants) and pretty much a seventh of the world record for the largest amount of birds seen in a year. Still, I don’t know what my record is, as I have never made one, but I think I can beat it because I already have 17 lifers, which is a bonus 17 birds to whatever I had before. Sure, I haven’t yet seen a Great Egret, Eastern Reef Egret, Nankeen Night-heron or Tawny Frogmouth yet, but I think I’ll manage to add them on. There are of course lots and lots of birds I haven’t got on the list that I’ve seen before, but if I’ve seen them, they can’t be harder than any other. So as long as we keep going to good bird places, I can increase the list up to 100. Tomorrow, we are going to a bird walk at Point Cook, so I can only hope I’ll see some new birds there, and if I keep on increasing, I’m sure I can get 100 in under a month. That is, if we keep going on bird walks, which might get tough considering the school year.
                
                Today is Saturday, 28 January. We went to the bird walk at Point Cook today and I saw a lot of birds. The day started off with breakfast, I had too much pomegranate, well not really too much but I didn’t have a good amount. Not like I even usually have any. Anyway, I can stop talking about breakfast and talk about the walk. We set off on the walk, we were slightly late but we managed to catch up with the group who had only moved about 20 metres out from the start and had stopped again to look at some Superb Fairy-wrens. I really don’t know why you should stop just for something like that, but then again, a year ago I would have been greatly excited by one. We walked around that place for a while, with me not adding anything new and then we went back to the car and drove to a different pond. There were lots and lots of Grey and Chestnut teals, as well as a few Australasian Grebes. They were a new bird for the list, so now I was on 83. After staying at that pond for ages, we moved on to the next place. This was a huge marsh-like place with a big lake behind. I saw a Yellow-rumped Thornbill and a Golden-headed Cisticola there but they weren’t new birds. But, a flock of Black-winged Stilts showed up, so it was worthwhile. I had been hoping for these at Werribee Treatment Plant but no showed up, so it was good to get the stilts now. After that stop, we went to a swamp where we stopped for a while. I was glad of that, because there I added Dusky Moorhen, White-plumed Honeyeater, which was an exciting lifer, and European Goldfinch, which was a not so exciting lifer. Well, I mean I was excited to see it, but seriously, it’s an introduced bird from Europe and who can like an introduced bird? We kept walking near there, and I got Tree Martin, thanks to some other birders mentioning them coming down and that they had white rumps. So Tree Martin was my 88th bird. I added Purple Swamphen as 89, even though I hadn’t seen them today, I had seen them previously and forgotten to put them on, so now was a good chance to. After that, we had lunch in a shady place under the trees. The total of how many species everyone had seen added up to 40. After lunch, we did a walk to the beach, and we passed a place where we spotted a raptor. It turned out to be a juvenile Brown Goshawk, which was yet another lifer and my 90th bird. After that 90th bird, we came to where the other birders showed us three Pied Cormorants. But I identified one of them as a Black-faced Cormorant, so that was two new cormorants. I had never seen a Black-faced Cormorant either. And then later, at some rocks we picked up Red-necked Stint and Common Tern, which was a lifer and the final bird for my list today. So I am on 94 birds - only six birds till 100. Which is my goal. But I think I’d better set the marks higher because this looks like a real birding year. Well, I don’t know yet. I’ve had good experience so far, going on holiday right at the start at Metung and Jindabyne, then getting back in the school holidays for the Western Treatment Plant and Point Cook, but the rest of the year isn’t going to be this bird-packed. 
                
                Yesterday, after the bird walk, two possums turned up in the plum tree. They had not been there before and must’ve just gotten through the net when my dad said he wouldn’t bother closing it because the rats could just gnaw through. The first one came last night, and this morning another possum joined it. I don’t really mind them eating our plums, after all they’re native wildlife so they deserve to have some if they like them. But those rats are really annoying. And thanks to our neighbours who seem to be feeding pigeons, rats have come into our property. I wouldn’t mind if they stayed over the fence, because if anything the neighbours deserve rats if they’re gonna have pigeons, but the fact that they come into our property really annoys me. I personally think that we should just report them, but other people have different ideas. I am going to school tomorrow, but we are going on a bird walk this Sunday, so I think I’ll be able to get up to 100. 
                
                Yesterday was the first day of school. It was alright, but I won’t spend all day describing it. 
                At recess, we were working on a tree house and I was the only one in the tree. This was an abandoned one that we started last year and when I lifted a board up out scuttled this really cool smooth gecko, and it had those cool gecko feet. Anyway, I thought I wouldn’t add any birds but this school has a lot of trees, and believe it or not, a Tawny Frogmouth turned up. They had come before in previous years and they were a species that I was hoping for the list. I first heard when word got around that there was a frogmouth in the front garden, and like I am I immediately raced off, you bet. But, I couldn’t find the tree which was really stressful and suspected it had flown off. But when the person who had told me came round, he said I was looking in the wrong tree. So we walked a bit down the path, and suddenly I came face to face with a Tawny Frogmouth. Like, since when do you see a Tawny Frogmouth in school? Well, I got a really good view of it and I say it must’ve been my happiest day. Because even though I’d seen the previous ones, this was the first time I’d made a year list and recently I’d been hungry for new birds. So Tawny Frogmouth was bird 95, and I only have 5 birds till 100.
                
                The people running the bird walk hadn’t replied but finally we received a reply that we could go. Which is good. Now it is already Saturday, so I hope I can pass the 100 mark by tomorrow. But now   I can only just wait and hope that I’ll be able to get the birds I need. I’m starting to want to go for the 200 mark, but it’ll be hard, because after all it’s school time and we’re not going on any cool holidays. The start of the year literally boosted my list up with a flush of new birds and lifers, but now it’s gone down to maybe one bird per week at average. Or probably way less. It used to be like something like 15 birds a day,  so it is a formidable drop that the list has gone down. Well anyway, I just hope that Yellingbo’s  gonna have some good birds.
                
                This morning we went to the Yellingbo Bird Walk. I was hoping for it to be good and it was. Along the way I sighted Rock Dove, Crested Pigeon, Galah, Little Corella and Australian Magpie, all already on my list. When we got there, the gate got opened and we went in. In the carpark, King Parrots flew over so they were another bird and when the walk started, Helmeted Honeyeaters fluttered around in the trees. Like actually Helmeted Honeyeaters. In my bird book, it said that the wild population is confined to Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve. The Helmeted Honeyeater was a lifer and it became my rarest bird. After that, we walked along for a bit sighting Grebes and Fairy-wrens, but nothing new. After a while, the guide pointed out a Spotted Pardalote in the tree.I’d seen one once before, but it was still mildly exciting. Shortly after, an Eastern Yellow Robin was sighted, and it became my 99th bird. So whatever bird I saw next would become 100! I was hoping for a good one, and a good one came. We went to a sort of field, where nothing was to be seen except some Eastern Rosellas in a dead tree. But I noticed the other half of the group looking at something over on the other side and when I got there, I saw a Rufous Fantail fluttering about. This was a lifer for me and I had always wished to see one. And it was so beautiful. So I can be very happy that I got Rufous Fantail as 100. Shortly afterwards, someone heard the call of a flycatcher, and it was probably a Satin. So we looked in the trees, and although I saw many flycatcher like shapes in the trees, I couldn’t confirm it. Along that path, there were lots of Pied Currawongs, which seemed to be scaring away the smaller birds and the guide pointed out some White-naped Honeyeaters. I hadn’t seen these before but I didn’t get a good look at them. After some more walking I spotted a male Satin Flycatcher in a tree right in front of me. That was very exciting. Later we saw a lot of them. There was a dam nearby but not much was to be seen. Everyone spent a long time looking at a couple of Australian Shelducks, a few Purple Swamphens, two Wood Ducks, and a Dusky Moorhen. But we couldn’t move on further from there, so we headed in the direction of the carpark. Along the way back, everyone kept spotting Satins, but one of the birds I saw was different, and I identified it as a Fan-tailed Cuckoo. That was a lifer for me, and no one else saw it. I was pretty excited about that. Later, my dad spotted a honeyeater in a tree, and I looked at it, and later identified it as a White-eared Honeyeater. But the honeyeater hopped next to another bird. I switched to that one, which was medium-sized and plump and grey. I asked one of the other birdwatchers about it and he said it was probably a Grey Shrike-thrush. But later, everyone saw a Grey Shrike-thrush, and now I was sure that the one that I had seen earlier was one of them. After that, we returned to the car park to have lunch. At lunch, there were some Brown Thornbills in the tree and the total amount of species that everyone had seen was 52 or something like that. After lunch, some people left early but a dozen kept going, including us. Along the way, some people were looking at a Silvereye. And I saw it dart into a bush. Afterwards, a big raptor was spotted, and I was thinking it was something new. But in the end everyone agreed on immature and juvenile Wedge-tailed Eagle, which were already on the list. Still, it was exciting to see it anyway and I would have been hugely excited if I had not already seen one at Jindabyne. We turned back around there, and on the way back, everyone saw a Sacred Kingfisher, which was an addition to my Kingfisher section, and just along, an Eastern Spinebill, which was for my honeyeater section. Afterwards, when we got home, I decided that I’d seen the silvereyes before in the year, so I’d add it anyway. And when I got all the species added up, guess what? I had 107 birds!! 
                
                Yesterday, it was another school day, and I saw some more exciting stuff. First of all, while we were playing an outside game in the front garden, I spotted some King Parrots. They were feeding, and I ended up just quitting the game to observe the parrots. These were dead cert King Parrots, because I had been unsure about the ones in the parking lot at Yellingbo. They flew around the front, and while I was watching them, I noticed a Noisy Miner go to its nest. I wanted to see a baby miner, so I climbed up the tree, and saw two dear little babies in the nest. They looked like little bald orange things with orange beaks and grey fluff partly covering their body. Then, the mother came and let me know I didn’t belong there so I just hopped down feeling very happy that I had finally seen what a baby miner looked like. Well, this school seems like it is a very good birding place anyway. I couldn’t really decide what was more exciting - a Tawny Frogmouth and a Marbled Gecko, or two King Parrots and two baby Noisy Miners. 
                
                Today, me and my dad set out on an expedition to try and get a Nankeen Night-Heron, a Powerful Owl, or at least a Bell Miner. Well we went to Fern Gully, which was where people had been reporting Powerful Owls, but after a lot of walking none showed up which was sad. We also went around the whole lake looking for the Night-herons, but none showed up either which was even more tragic. Well, I was pretty unhappy that nothing had been seen, but on the island there were Bell Miners in the trees, which made things a bit better. Now I can have a Miners section, and plus they were one additional bird. And every new bird matters! So now my bird list was on a pleasing 109.
                
                Just yesterday, at school two two Tawny Frogmouths showed up which was strange because we had previously seen one. It wasn’t a new bird for my list, but still it was exciting to see them in the garden. Today I decided that the honeyeater in the tree was a Blue-faced Honeyeater and a raptor that we spotted at Mount Kosciuszcko as an Australian Hobby. I also decided that the birds in Jindabyne were Little Friarbirds, so that is 111 birds in a list. Three of the same digits, that is pretty good I won’t get any more of that until 222. I actually haven’t been seeing any more birds. I did figure out the list was actually on 112 but that doesn’t matter. Anyway, I just think I might want to go to the river or somewhere so I can see some more - just being inside and in our garden isn’t gonna get me anything. So yeah, I’m thinking about that. We might also be going on a pelagic trip at Port Fairy, camping in the Grampians or somewhere else, so I have some more chances for new birds. And plus, we have three Birdlife Melbourne beginners outings in the school holidays, and the Yellingbo Bird Walk for March is coming up soon. So I really think that I should be able to, but if you blame me for not updating the book, this is why. But, I just made an amazing discovery! Or two. Because I realised that I was 100% sure that the mysterious Currawong at Jindabyne was a Grey Currawong!!!!!! Ok, any real great 700 life list birders will laugh that I’m excited at a Grey Currawong, but to be honest I had just thought it was a Pied Currawong. And now I’m 100% sure. I just thought: grey=juvenile currawong and didn’t bother to check. But then I realised a juvenile Pied Currawong was brown all over without a yellow eye, while the Grey Currawong nominate race is exactly like the one I saw. So that is a great bird. But it didn’t add anything, as I decided that Little Friarbird was just silly and I couldn’t confirm it so I took it off, but it still fills in the gap, and deciding that some Kites at the treatment plant were Black Kites, I had one more bird in. They were distinguished by the forked tail, and that I searched up black kite call, and the call was exactly right. So yeah, I’m on 113 birds now. Recently, I haven’t been observing anything new - a lot of Little Corellas, and I had a dream where I saw a Little Egret in school and woke up much annoyed. Either way, I haven’t got anything new, but we are planning to go on the Port Fairy Pelagic in April, and Lady Elliot Island starting on the 28th December. Also, I’ll be going to the Grampians in school camp sometime soon - maybe March? So I have a lot to look forward to. I just hope I can get something new!</p>
